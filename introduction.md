# Getting strated with Machine Learning

Before getting started with this course its important that you hav a basic understanding of the following concepts.

- Python basics.

Its also recommede that you have the following:

- A loca python environment set up in you machine or access to _Google Colab_
- Github account - Since you alredy here we assume that you have one.
- Kaggle account - Kaggle is the leading platform for data scientist, it is reccomended you create an account to also learn from others.

## From us to you

## Introduction to Machine Learning.

Some methods used to predict future events have been uncoventional and heavily unreliable, some of this cases of pediction have exploited human emotions a great case study is the [Y2K problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem) in which religious leades took this cahnce to predict the end of the world.

The amount of data has grown rapidly over the last ten years
