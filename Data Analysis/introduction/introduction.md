# End-to-end machine learning project

In this lesson we will look at how machine learning projects are carried at with some sample code.
Here are the main steps we will be going through:

1. Getting the data
2. Data cleaning
3. Data analysis
4. Data preparation for machine learning algorithms
5. Model selection and training
6. Model fine tuning
7. Presenting the solution
8. Model deployment
